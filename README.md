This project introduces a novel deep transfer learning framework for tea leaf quality analysis using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). It leverages:
•	CNN + Capsule Network architecture
•	Improved Pooling Attention (IPA)
•	Meta-Baseline Few-Shot Learning
•	Hyperparameter tuning with Greedy Search + GHO
•	Transfer Learning + Data Augmentation
The model is built to identify and classify different grades of Longjing tea leaves based on complex spatial and spectral features.

This project is useful in: 
•	This project significantly improves the accuracy of tea quality detection compared to traditional models like CNN, LSTM, and CNN-Capsule Networks.
•	It effectively handles the challenge of limited labeled data through advanced data augmentation and deep transfer learning techniques.
•	The model is capable of capturing subtle, fine-grained differences in tea leaf quality that are often difficult to detect through manual inspection.
•	It offers a practical solution to automate the quality control process for tea producers and researchers, enhancing efficiency and consistency.
•	The approach is highly adaptable and can be extended to other agricultural applications or spectral classification tasks beyond tea analysis.
The project is started by:
Install required libraries: The code is written in Python (colab Notebook), and need libraries like tensorflow, keras, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib.
Load the dataset: hyperspectral image dataset is used and split into train test. 
Open the Code.ipynb file in google colab and follow the steps from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
Use the greedy + GHO optimization function provided to fine-tune model performance.
